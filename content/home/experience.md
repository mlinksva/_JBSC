  description = """My main projects include work on projects with the National Center for Science andEngineering Statistics (NCSES) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA). My NCSES work includes a project on measuring the scope and impact ofopen source software through mining software repositories, applying cost-based valua-tion, sectoring contributions through a national accounts framework, and social networkanalysis on collaboration networks. Another NCSES project includes understanding theskilled-technical workforce pathways and impact of non-degree credentials using onlinejob advertisements and resumes. My third main project is DARPA’s ComputationalSimulation of Online Social Behavior (SocialSim) challenge developing platforms for high-fidelity computational simulation of online social behavior and understanding the life-cycleof narratives on social media. I also support our team’s infrastructure working closelywith Research Computing to ensure our team has access and knowledge to effectively useavailable computing resources for our research (e.g., high performance computing). Lastly,during the Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars summer program, I co-teachsome of the lessons during the training as well as participate or lead various projects.
