  description = """My main projects include work on projects with the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). My NCSES work includes a project on measuring the scope and impact of open source software through mining software repositories, applying cost-based valuation, sectoring contributions through a national accounts framework, and social network analysis on collaboration networks. Another NCSES project includes understanding the skilled-technical workforce pathways and impact of non-degree credentials using online job advertisements and resumes. My third main project is DARPA's Computational Simulation of Online Social Behavior (SocialSim) challenge developing platforms for high-fidelity computational simulation of online social behavior and understanding the life-cycle of narratives on social media. I also support our team's infrastructure working closely with Research Computing to ensure our team has access and knowledge to effectively use available computing resources for our research (e.g., high performance computing). Lastly, during the Data Science for the Public Good Young Scholars summer program, I co-teach some of the lessons during the training as well as participate or lead various projects.

Their abilities and dedication to the program goals and the individual student-participants are unparalleled and students and faculty universally remark that follows' contributions exceed by far what is common for even top-rated teaching and research assistants in graduate education.
