OS-level virtualization is a key feature of data science. The idea is to have a contained environment that provides functionality, security, and replicability.

For single machines one of the best implementations of OS-level virtualization is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). However, in multi-user systems such a high-performance computing (HPC), the preferred solution is [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/).

The easiest way to start becoming familiar with Docker is through the GUI application [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) part of the Docker Desktop [application](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
