Version control is essential for data science and software development. A simple way to incorporate version control is through using Git and a remote hosting platform. Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development, but can be used as well for research, content, and many other types of source code. The best way to use Git is to incorporate a remote (a copy of the project) in a remote hosting platform such as GitHub.

A nice tool to use Git with with a Git client such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) an open source Git client for desktops that can be used with any Git remote. This tool makes it very easy to perform basic pipelines. For more advanced use, one may need to become familiar with the Git command line tools.
